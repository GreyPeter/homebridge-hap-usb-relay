# homebridge-hap-usb-relay

Homebridge control of a mcp2200 based relay board to Open/Close a Garage Door.

Largely based on Raspberry Pi GPIO Garage Door Opener. 
See https://github.com/benlamonica/homebridge-rasppi-gpio-garagedoor.

Also requires node-hid to be installed. 
See https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid for info.

Works with Denkovi MCP2000 based USB Relay Module 4 Channels DAE-CB/Ro4/MCP2200-JQC-USB.
